# Pyspark-Recommendation-System

The project is a savior for binge-watchers spending lots of time finding their perfect fit in movies. The project deals with a movie recommendation system. It is powered by a spark dataframe which allows it to handle a large set of data ( which we call Big data) and make recommendations. 
The project runs on ALS recommendation model and runs over a web API. To make the project much more user interactive, the project uses a chatbot like interphase.
